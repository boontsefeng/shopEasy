Option A: Using XAMPP (Recommended)

Download and install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/
Start the XAMPP Control Panel and start the MySQL service
Open phpMyAdmin by clicking the "Admin" button next to MySQL
Create a new database named shopeasy

2. Setting up Apache Tomcat 10

Download Apache Tomcat 10 from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi
Extract the downloaded file to a location on your computer (e.g., C:\tomcat10 or /opt/tomcat10)

Configuring Tomcat Admin Panel

Navigate to the conf directory in your Tomcat installation
Edit the tomcat-users.xml file and add the following lines before the closing </tomcat-users> tag:
xml<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="password" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui"/>

Save and close the file
Start Tomcat by running the startup.bat (Windows) or startup.sh (Linux/Mac) script from the bin directory
Access the Tomcat admin panel at http://localhost:8080/manager/html
Log in with the credentials you set in tomcat-users.xml

3. Setting up NetBeans with Tomcat

Open NetBeans IDE
Go to Tools > Servers

javapublic class DBUtil {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/shopeasy";
    private static final String USERNAME = "root";
    private static final String PASSWORD = ""; // Make sure this matches your local MySQL password
    
    // Rest of the class...
}
